# New Year Party 2016
## What?
We are writing simple pygame + python3.5 game to have fun and to deliver fun to players.
## How to contibute?
If you're part of main team:

1. `git pull`
1. `git branch [your_github_username-dev]`
1. `git checkout [your_github_username-dev]`
1. do changes and push to github
1. tell repository keeper to do merge into master for you

Alternatively, you can push into master, but remember:

1. if we can start game after your push, it will be rolled back

Also try to make your branches as easy for merge as possible.
Thanks for attention
